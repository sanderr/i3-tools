# i3-tools
Collection of scripts and other tools that make i3 life easier.

The *tools/* directory contains the tools. A list of which tools I added
follows next.

## i3SwitchWorkspace

This is a script to simplify switching between workspaces in a multi-monitor
environment. It is especially useful when you often change your setup.
I, for example, work with just 1 screen when on the road, while I use
a DisplayPort screen at home, and an HDMI screen at work. This script
makes sure I can use the same shortcuts for primary and secondary screen
respectively, whichever those are.

## i3CycleWorkspace

Probably redundant. It seems `workspace next` and `workspace prev` offer
the same functionality. I'm not sure if it's exactly the same, I haven't
tested the built-in functionality yet.
